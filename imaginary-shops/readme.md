# Product Placement in Imaginary Grocery Stores

This folder gathers floor plans of various imaginary grocery stores. Though the interest was mainly related with the
dairy product placement, the floor plans include the position of other products as well. 

## Experiment Design

The participants were given a list of grocery store product categories. The list was mapped in one of the grocery stores in Tallinn, Estonia.
Thereafter, the participants were asked to draw a floor plan of an imaginary grocery store including the position of the aforementioned
categories. The participants were free to choose the size of the grocery store as well as the position of the entry and exit points.
They were not told that the aim of the experiment is to determine the position of the dairy products in context of the entry point
and other products. The categories to be mapped included (Estonian translations in parentheses):

* `Bakery (pagar)`
* `Pizza (pitsa)`
* `Ready-made food (valmistoit)`
* `Meat (liha)`
* `Fish (kala)`
* `Dairy products (piimatooted)`
* `Alcoholic beverages (alkohoolsed joogid)`
* `Ice cream (jäätis)`
* `Sport (sport)`
* `Snacks (snäkid)`
* `Home (kodu)`
* `Consumer goods (tarbekaubad)`
* `Biscuits (küpsised)`
* `Hot drinks (kuumad joogid)`
* `Sauces and oils (kastmed ja õlid)`
* `Conserves (hoidised)`

## Results

Imaginary grocery stores where the milk was placed to the farthest spot from the entry point when compared with other products included to this study:

* `sample-2`
* `sample-5`
* `sample-6`
* 
Imaginary grocery stores where at least one of the products from the comparative pool was father from the entry point than the milk:

* `sample-1`
* `sample-7`
* `sample-8`

Indecisive:

* `sample-3`
* `sample-4`
* `sample-9`
