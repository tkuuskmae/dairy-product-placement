# Dairy product placement field study

This repository gathers floor plans of various grocery stores around the world as well as floor plans of imaginary
grocery stores drawn by participants of a dairy product placement field study. The floor plans constitute the source materials
for a discovery project into the meaningfulness of the dairy product placement. 

The focus of the study delves into the position of the dairy products, especially milk in comparison
to the shop's entry. According to a popular hypothesis, dairy products are placed as far as possible
from the entry point. The field study set out to test this hypothesis in two ways:

1. I visited various grocery stores around Europe and North America and drew approximate floor plans
   including the position of dairy products, especially milk, in relation to the entry point and
   3 other products. In other words, if the dairy products were to be found at the farthest spot
   from the entry point when compared with other products, it would support the widely spread 
    assumption.

2. By asking participants to draw imaginary grocery stores including the position of various product categories
   I wanted to see where the customer would place the dairy products in relation to other products and the entry point.
   Therefore, if the participants would place the dairy products to the farthest spot from the entry point
   when compared with other products, it would not only support the widely spread assumption but also indicate
   that the customers also prefer this placement strategy and expect to find the dairy products at the
   farthest spot from the entry point.

## Real Shops

The subsection [real-shops](./real-shops) includes floor plans of various grocery stores around Europe
and the North America. The floor plans were drawn based on the actual grocery stores visited by the author.
All the additional details, principles used and results are described in the subsection.


## Imaginary Shops

The subsection [imaginary-shops](./imaginary-shops) includes floor plans of various imaginary grocery stores
drawn by participants of a dairy product placement field study. The floor plans were drawn based on
the instructions given to the participants. All the additional details, principles used and results are
described in the subsection.
