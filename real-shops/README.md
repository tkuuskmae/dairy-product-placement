# Dairy product placement

This repository gathers floor plans of various grocery stores around the Europe. It constitutes the source materials for a discovery project into the effectiveness of the dairy product placement.

## Criteria

Due to the lack of other measurement options, the floor size was gauged in steps. In the UK case (London) floor dimensions are missing. Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was used to draw the floor plans, place the entry and exit points as well as the position of the observed goods:

- apples
- bread
- cereals
- milk

The exact correlation of the diagram's x and y axis to the factual size of the shop was not important. The focus of the study delves into the position of the dairy products, escpecially milk in comparison to the shop's entry. According to a popular hypothesis, dairy products are placed as far as possible from the entry point. Thus, the approximate floor plans are good enough.

At first, the time measurements (walking distance from one product to another) were also recorded, but later it turned out that this information was obsolete. The brand names were replaced with numbers. For instance, `tallinn-1` represents one grocery store brand and `tallinn-2` represents another. All grocery chains included to the study were mapped only once and based on one specific representation. It was noticed that some other representations of the same chain differed in some regards. However, the choice on the representations to include was completely random.

## Results

Grocery store representations where the milk was placed to the farthest spot from the entry point when compared with other products included to this study:

* `amsterdam-1`
* `amsterdam-2`
* `amsterdam-3`
* `gdansk-1`
* `gdansk-2`
* `geneva-2`
* `helsinki-1`
* `helsinki-2`
* `helsinki-3`
* `helsinki-4`
* `london-1`
* `tallinn-2`
* `tallinn-3`
* `tallinn-4`
* `tallinn-6`
* `stockholm-1`
* `halifax-2`
* `washington-1`

Grocery store representations where at least one of the products from the comparative pool was father from the entry point than the milk:

* `geneva-1`
* `london-2`
* `london-3`
* `london-4`
* `tallinn-1`
* `tallinn-5`
* `halifax-1`
* `washington-2`
* `washington-3`

## Discussion
As it can be observed from the results, in most of the visited grocery stores (66% )the milk was placed to the farthest
spot  from  the entry point when compared with other products. This supports the widely spread assumption that dairy
products are placed  as far as possible from the entry point.
