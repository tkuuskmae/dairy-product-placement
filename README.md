# Dairy product placement

This repository gathers floor plans of various grocery stores around the Europe. It constitutes the source materials for a discovery project into the effectiveness of the dairy product placement.

Due to the lack of other measurement options, the floor size was gauged in steps. In the UK case (London) floor dimensions are missing. Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was used to draw the floor plans, place the entry and exit points as well as the position of the observed goods:

- apples
- bread
- cereals
- milk

The exact correlation of the diagram's x and y axis to the factual size of the shop was not important. The focus of the study delves into the position of the dairy products, escpecially milk in comparison to the shop's entry. According to a popular hypothesis, dairy products are placed as far as possible from the entry point. Thus, the approximate floor plans are good enough.

At first, the time measurements (walking distance from one product to another) were also recorded, but later it turned out that this information was obsolete.
